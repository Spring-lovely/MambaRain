# MambaRain Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the MambaRain Project! This initiative aims to develop an efficient and accurate long-term precipitation nowcasting framework. Through an innovative hybrid architecture and loss function design, we overcome the performance bottlenecks of traditional approaches for 0-3 hour forecasts and deliver more reliable technical support for meteorological decision‑making. Watch the following promotional video to quickly discover the strengths and features of MambaRain.

## Project Features
- [Multi‑Scale Spatio‑Temporal Modeling:Integrates Mamba’s long‑range temporal memory with self‑attention mechanisms to simultaneously capture the global evolution of storm systems and local convective details.]
- [Terrain-aware Forecasting:Enhances precipitation prediction accuracy in complex terrains (e.g., mountains, coastlines) by incorporating DEM geographic data.]
- [Cross‑Region Generalization:Validated on datasets from both the arid Xinjiang region and the humid southeast of China, achieving an average CSI improvement of over 12 %.]
